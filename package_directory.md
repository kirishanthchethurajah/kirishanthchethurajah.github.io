Package Directory

The Package Directory allows you to browse the software that is
available

Package Sets and Packages
-------------------------

-   [Package Sets](/sets) contain the build system configuration that
    define groups of packages.
-   [Packages](/pkg) are where the code itself is stored. What you
    usually want to do is find the packages that are of interest to you
    and add them to your local installation. In addition to package
    information (dependencies, â€¦), links to the package API are also
    provided (if the package generates an API documentation using e.g.
    Doxygen)

oroGen information
------------------

[oroGen](documentation/orogen) is the component-based integration layer
used in Rock.

-   [oroGen Tasks](/tasks) The list of oroGen tasks that are defined on
    this system, along with links to the API documentation (generated by
    Doxygen) and to the autoproj package that define them.
-   [oroGen Types](/types) The list of types that are registered through
    oroGen on this system (i.e. used in tasks), along with links to the
    API documentation (generated by Doxygen) and to the autoproj package
    that define them.

OS Dependencies
---------------

The OS dependencies are a way to use the underlying operating system
package management system, i.e. to install packages prebuilt for your
system instead of building things from source.

The [OS dependencies](/osdeps) pages list the OS dependencies
definition, i.e. for an osdeps name (which is a simple name referring to
a software), which packages would be installed on which operating
system.
