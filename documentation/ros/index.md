<p>This section of the documentation will detail how to integrate ROS within a Rock
system.</p>

<h2 id="current-state">Current state</h2>

<p>In its current state, the Rock and ROS can interoperate at the level of the
dataflow, i.e. one can transfer data between Rock ports and ROS topics.</p>

<p>This section will guide you through:</p>

<ul>
<li>what ROS messages are generated by a Rock system, and how to modify the
default behaviour in that respect</li>
<li>how to connect Rock components with ROS nodes</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>extend the runtime behaviour to be able to bypass roslaunch completely within
<a href="../runtime/">Ruby runtime scripts</a></li>
<li>allow usage of ROS nodes within <a href="../system/">Syskit</a></li>
</ul>
