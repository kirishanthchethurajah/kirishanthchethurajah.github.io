               <p>The first step to consider when integrating a ROS and a Rock system is the issue
of making both systems understand each other. In other terms, use compatible
data types.</p>

<p>Rock and ROS do not share the same scheme when it comes to defining data types.
ROS uses its own message description format, while Rock uses a subset of C++ &ndash;
mainly for ease of integration of &ldquo;framework-free&rdquo; libraries.</p>

<p>The two possible schemes to transfer data between Rock components and ROS nodes
are described <a href="../orogen/transports/ros.html">in the oroGen documentation</a></p>
