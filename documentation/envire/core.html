<h2 id="creation--object-ownership">Creation &amp; Object Ownership</h2>

<p>The main envire class is envire::Environment. It holds all the elements of the
environment and stores them in the different structures. In general, all
elements that are stored in an environment are derived from
envire::EnvironmentItem. Object ownership of EnvironmentItem is shared through
the used of boost::intrusive_ptr reference counting. Holding such a pointer is
simplified through the use of the ::Ptr typedef, which is available in all
classes derived from EnvironmentItem. Creating and attaching an EnvironmentItem
works like this</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;envire/Core.hpp&gt;
using namespace envire;

...

// create an Environment on the stack
Environment env;

// EnvironmentItem objects (such as FrameNode)
// need to be created on the heap.
// The FrameNode::Ptr type performs the reference
// counting for shared ownership
FrameNode::Ptr frame = new FrameNode;

// This will make the frame known to the environment
env.attachItem( frame );
</code></pre>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the overview page, there are four different types of objects
that the environment does distinguish. FrameNode, CartesianMap, Layer and
Operator.  Each of these objects has a different structure that the environment
stores.</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <p>The <strong>FrameNodes</strong> are organized in a tree structure. Any environment always has
at least one FrameNode, which is the root FrameNode. This one can be
considered the world origin reference frame. All FrameNodes that are added to
the environment need to be attached to a parent node, so that operations
relating it to other frames are valid. Further, each CartesianMap can be
assigned to be associated with one FrameNode. </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>The <strong>LayerTree</strong> provides structure within maps. Like the FrameNode structure,
this is a tree. However, there is no single tree root, so multiple trees are
allowed here. A root node is a layer that does not have a parent. This structure
is used to store relationships within maps, e.g. level of detail or other types
of hierarchical maps.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>The <strong>OperatorGraph</strong> is a structure that links operators to layers. Each operator
can have multiple inputs and outputs. Operators work through lazy handling of
map updates. So that for a certain input map, if the map is flagged as modified, the
operator can decide if and what of the output needs to be updated. This is
useful in situations, where the structure of the environment changes, and this
has implications on derived information.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="warning"><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> The OperatorGraph functionality is currently not fully implemented. The
structure for holding operators exists, but no automatic chaining of lazy operations or
partial updates is implemented, yet. </p>

<p>The Environment provides a number of operations to modify the listed structures.
All operations, where it makes sense, also have the feature that they will
automatically attach an item to the environment if this has not yet happened.</p>

<p>The following is an example which is taken from the envire/test/unit/core.hpp
unit tests and the resulting structure visualised with the GraphViz file
generation class.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE( environment )
{
  // set up an environment
  boost::scoped_ptr&lt;Environment&gt; env( new Environment() );

  // an environment should always have a root node
  BOOST_CHECK( env-&gt;getRootNode() );

  // create some child framenodes
  FrameNode *fn1, *fn2, *fn3;
  fn1 = new FrameNode();
  fn1-&gt;setTransform(
    Eigen::Affine3d(
  Eigen::Translation3d( 0.0, 0.0, 0.5 )) );
  fn2 = new FrameNode();
  fn2-&gt;setTransform(
    Eigen::Affine3d(
  Eigen::Quaterniond(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0 )));
  fn3 = new FrameNode();
  fn3-&gt;setTransform(
    Eigen::Affine3d(
  Eigen::Translation3d(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)));

  // attach explicitely
  env-&gt;attachItem( fn1 );
  env-&gt;addChild( env-&gt;getRootNode(), fn1 );

  // implicit attachment
  env-&gt;addChild( fn1, fn2 );

  // setup the rest of the framenodes
  env-&gt;addChild( env-&gt;getRootNode(), fn3 );

  // perform a relative transformation
  FrameNode::TransformType rt1 =
env-&gt;relativeTransform(fn2, fn1);

  FrameNode::TransformType rt2 =
env-&gt;relativeTransform(fn2, fn3);

  // now do the same for layers
  Layer *l1, *l2, *l3;
  l1 = new DummyLayer();
  l2 = new DummyLayer();
  l3 = new DummyLayer();

  env-&gt;attachItem( l1 );
  env-&gt;addChild( l1, l2 );
  env-&gt;attachItem(l3);

  // CartesianMaps should work the same
  CartesianMap *m1, *m2;
  m1 = new DummyCartesianMap();
  m2 = new DummyCartesianMap();

  env-&gt;attachItem( m1 );
  env-&gt;attachItem( m2 );

  env-&gt;setFrameNode( m1, fn1 );
  env-&gt;setFrameNode( m2, fn1 );

  // now to operators
  Operator *o1;
  o1 = new DummyOperator();
  env-&gt;attachItem( o1 );

  env-&gt;addInput( o1, m1 );
  env-&gt;addInput( o1, m2 );
  env-&gt;addOutput( o1, l2 );

  GraphViz gv;
  gv.writeToFile( env.get(), "build/test/env.dot" );
}

<h2 id="serialization">Serialization</h2>

<p>Envire provides a system for serialization and deserialization. The
functionality is capsuled in a serialization class. In order to save an
environment you can use the following method</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">#incude &lt;envire/Core.hpp&gt;
using namespace envire;

...
Serialization so;
// create the environment (and store in scoped ptr)
boost::scoped_ptr&lt;Environment&gt; env( new Environment() );
// fill the environment
...

// write the environment to disk
so.serialize(env.get(), "build/test/");
</code></pre>

<p>Loading the environment is equally simple. The unserialize method will take a
file name and return a pointer to the newly created environment. Object
ownership is passed to the caller, who is expected to delete the object after
use (using a scoped_ptr in this example).</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">// load the environment
boost::scoped_ptr&lt;Environment&gt;
  env( so.unserialize( "build/test" ) );
</code></pre>

<p>The way envire writes the files to disk is fairly simple. The file name provided
is the name of a directory. Envire will use the full directory for its own use.
It will generate a scene.yml file, which stores the structure of the environment
in a yaml file format. This file can be easily adapted for small changes. The
scene.yml may also contain parameters relevant to the particular
EnvironmentItem, like e.g. a frame transformation for a FrameNode, or flags for
an operator.</p>

<p>Every EnvironmentItem that is attached to the environment gets an id, which is
unique in that environment. The id is used when serialized to reference the
object. </p>

<p>There are two ways EnvironmentItems store information about themselves. One is the
structural information which ends up in the scene.yml, and also includes
parameters. Further, items can (but don&rsquo;t need to) store information in a
separate file. This is mostly useful for maps. Each item can pick their own
format, so using formats which are readable by others is recommended for maps. </p>
