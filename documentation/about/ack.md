<p>If you are using Rock and present the work you&rsquo;ve done using it, we would be
glad if you could acknowledge the project. In general, the citation would be:</p>

<pre>
Rock: The Robot Construction Kit (http://rock-robotics.org)
</pre>

<p>It is better to cite this website&rsquo;s URL as well as the project name.</p>

<p>Latex users can also use <a href="rock.bib">this bibtex entry</a></p>
