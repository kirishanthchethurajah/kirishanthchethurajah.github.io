<p>This page explains how to install Rock and where to look for more
information (tutorials, &hellip;).</p>

<h2 id="level-of-support">Level of support</h2>
<p>This section lists the operating systems where Rock is <em>well tested</em>, is <em>untested</em> and where the status is <em>unknown</em>.
For <em>well tested</em> operating systems, our <a href="http://rock-robotics.org/status">build server makes sure that Rock builds
fine</a>, and it is known to be actively used. <em>Untested</em> operating systems have
had users (so, it did work at some point), but it is unknown whether it is
still being actively used. Finally, <em>unknown status</em> operating systems are OS&rsquo;s where
Rock should work, but we have had no known report of its success or failure.</p>

<h2 id="installation-the-easy-way">Installation: the easy way</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure that the Ruby interpreter is installed on your machine. Rock
requires ruby 2.0 or higher, which is provided on Debian and Ubuntu by
the ruby2.0 package. However we <strong>recommend the use of ruby 2.1</strong> for all OS&rsquo;s
except Ubuntu 14.04, where ruby2.0 should be chosen.</p>

    <pre><code>ruby --version
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Create and &ldquo;cd&rdquo; into the directory in which you want to install the toolchain.</li>
  <li>
    <p>To build the core system of the latest release, use this
<a href="http://www.rock-robotics.org/master/bootstrap.sh">bootstrap.sh</a>
script. Save it in the folder you just created. For other options, see
below.</p>

    <p><strong>There is an important note for long-term Orocos users.</strong> See the red box
below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a console, run</p>

    <pre><code>sh bootstrap.sh
</code></pre>

    <p>If the command fails (1) report the problem / error to
<a href="http://www.dfki.de/mailman/cgi-bin/listinfo/rock-users">the rock-users mailing
list</a>,
(2) whatever you try to fix it, restart the bootstrapping by doing.</p>

    <pre><code>rm -rf autoproj
sh bootstrap.sh
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Important: as the build tool tells you, you <strong>must</strong> load the generated env.sh script at the end of the build !!!
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>source it in your current console</p>

        <p class="commandline">. ./env.sh</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>but also add it to your .bashrc: append the following line at the end of
$HOME/.bashrc</p>

        <p class="commandline">. /path/to/the/directory/env.sh</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Read the <a href="autoproj/basic_usage.html">autoproj guide for basic usage</a> to know the
basic operations of the build system. More bootstrapping documentation is
also available <a href="autoproj/bootstrap.html">at the same place</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="other-bootstrapping-options">Other bootstrapping options</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Build the master (development) version of rock</strong>
Use <a href="http://www.rock-robotics.org/master/bootstrap.sh">this bootstrap.sh</a> instead of the one listed above.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Build all of rock</strong>: Call </p>

    <pre><code>autoproj update --all-known-packages
autoproj build --all-known-packages
</code></pre>

    <p>after your basic installation is finished. &lsquo;'&rsquo;This is really meant for continuous integration servers&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;, it does not guarantee
a consistent installation if you forget to add &lsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;&ndash;all-known-packages&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo; to any autoproj call.
If you need a persistent complete installation of rock you must add all metapackages to your layout section.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create a custom version</strong>
Use one of the previous bootstrap scripts to install the base system and then cherry-pick the packages you want. Have a look at <a href="/package_directory.html">the package
directory</a> and add the package names to the
layout section in autoproj/manifest. For instance,  if you want to
get the <a href="../package_directory/packages/drivers_orogen_xsens_imu/index.html">Xsens IMU component</a>,
the layout section should look like:</p>

    <pre><code>layout:
   - rock.core
   - drivers/orogen/xsens_imu
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="warning">
  <p><strong>Important for existing Orocos users</strong> The development workflow in Rock
currently disables the Orocos deployer and the RTT scripting language by
default, as they are quite expensive on the build times. Select &ldquo;yes&rdquo; at the
&ldquo;compatibility with OCL&rdquo; question during the build to reenable this.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="maintaining-a-rock-installation">Maintaining a Rock installation</h2>

<p>Once Rock is installed, you can update your installation by going to the root of the
installation folder and do</p>

<p class="commandline">autoproj update <br />
autoproj build</p>

<p>You might have to reload the env.sh script after that as well, to export updated environment variables into your current shell. Simply opening a new console will do the trick (given you have added sourcing env.sh to your .bashrc).</p>
