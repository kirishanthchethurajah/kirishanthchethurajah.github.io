Adding packages

This is a summary of the ways you can ask autoproj to build a package
for you.

The first two ways described are for **local** packages, i.e. packages
that you don’t share with the rest of the world. The third one tells you
how to share it efficiently with other people

Building a new package
----------------------

When you create a new package, and want autoproj to build it, you can
simply add it to the autoproj’s main manifest. It will be picked up and
built by autoproj.

For instance, if I create a new Rock oroGen driver in

drivers/orogen/new\_driver

then I would edit autoproj/manifest and add

-   drivers/orogen/new\_driver

to the layout: section. The next time one calls

autoproj build

autoproj will announce that the new package has been picked up with a
message looking like

    auto-adding drivers/orogen/new_driver as an oroGen package

Importing a package from a VCS
------------------------------

The method above only works with packages that are already checked out.
To add a new package and have autoproj check it out for you, you need to
basically do two things:

-   declare it in an autobuild file (\*.autobuild)
-   add VCS information for it (i.e. “where to get it”)

A first step, if you don’t want to share that package to a wide
audience, is to add it to the local package set

-   [register it](advanced/autobuild.html) in `autoproj/local.autobuild`
-   [give version control information](advanced/importers.html) for it
    in `autoproj/overrides.yml`

Sharing package definitions with the rest of the world
------------------------------------------------------

To do that, you will either have to move the package definition to a
separate package set (usually one of those that are in
autoproj/remotes/), or to create your own package set]

For the first solution, you will have to move the package definition
from autoproj/local.autobuild you created in the previous step to an
autobuild file in the package set directory (the file name does not
matter as long as it ends with .autobuild). Moreover, you will have to
move the importer definition from autoproj/overrides.yml to the package
set’s source.yml file.

For instance, to add a package to the rock.drivers package set in a Rock
installation, one would move the autobuild file to
autoproj/remotes/rock.drivers/ and add the relevant VCS information to
autoproj/remotes/rock.drivers/source.yml
