<p>While previous tutorials refer to the <a href="../tutorials/500_simulate_a_robot.html">example
robot</a> controlled by joystick, we will
now have a look at how to set up an actual robot.</p>

<p>The following topics will be addressed by this tutorial, in the order in which
the steps are normally carried out when a new robot is set up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set up a new build system and add it to git version control</li>
  <li>Create the corresponding bundle as well as configuration files for tasks</li>
  <li>Configure the transformer</li>
</ul>
