<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to examine your task, have a look at and
log data produced by orogen tasks and finally how to replay them.</p>

<h2 id="task-inspector">Task Inspector</h2>
<p>While running a task, you can examine the task with the <em>Task Inspector</em>.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Open another console (don&rsquo;t forget to do &lsquo;. env.sh&rsquo; there)</li>
 <li>Start your message_consumer script from the previous tutorial (<em>~/dev/tutorials/orogen/messages/scripts/connect.rb</em>)</li>
 <li>In the other console, start the task inspector with <em>rock-display message_producer</em></li>
</ul>

<p>You will see the task inspector showing the message producer task. When you click it, the entry expands and shows a property section, input port section and an output port section. The output port section also shows the port called <em>messages</em>. When you click on an output port, the data sent by the port is being displayed, which allows you to examine it. </p>

<p>If started without arguments, the task inspector shows up all running tasks after
some delay (to select a different Corba Name Service than the local one, use the
option --host). A right-click on any output port or subtype allows to open available plugins able to display the selected data structure (if you wish to add your custom plugins, see &lsquo;Writing a Vizkit Plugin&rsquo;).</p>

<h2 id="logging-data">Logging Data</h2>
<p>By default, all tasks come with a logger component that allows writing the data of the output ports to a file.</p>

<p><strong>Activating logging:</strong> You can activate the logging by calling the ruby
method <em>log_all</em> from your ruby start script. If you only want to log the
ports or the properties of the tasks you can also call the methods
<em>log_all_ports</em> or <em>log_all_configuration</em> instead.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">...

Orocos.run 'message_producer::Task' =&gt; 'message_producer',
   'message_consumer::Task' =&gt; 'message_consumer' do
 Orocos.log_all
 message_producer = Orocos.name_service.get 'message_producer'
 message_consumer = Orocos.name_service.get 'message_consumer'

...
</code></pre>

<p>By default, all the logged data goes to log files called <em>your_task_name.x.log</em> in
the current working directory. In this case, all the logged data goes to<br />
message_producer.0.log. There is also a file message_consumer.0.log which
holds no data since the task has no output port. The digit in the end
increases automatically.</p>

<h2 id="rock-replay">rock-replay</h2>
<p>Rock is shipped with a command line tool for displaying the content of log
files. Therefore, if you want to look into a log file without replaying it to
the framework, you can call <em>rock-replay log_file.x.log</em> to get a graphical
overview of the logged data. By double clicking on a port name, Vizkit is
trying to find a widget plugin to display the data. If it cannot find one,
vizkit is using a generic struct viewer widget to display the content of the
sample (if you wish to add your custom plugins, see &lsquo;Writing a Vizkit Plugin&rsquo;).
To display the log file recorded above, call:  </p>

<p><em>rock-replay message_producer.0.log</em></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, you have learned to: </p>

<ul>
 <li>Examine a live task with rock-display,</li>
 <li>activate logging and</li>
 <li>visualize the logged data using rock-replay.</li>
</ul>
