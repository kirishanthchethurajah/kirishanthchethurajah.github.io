<p>This page will describe how to write/modify/update documentation on this very
website. Additional, discussion-oriented, documentation is done on the <a href="http://trac.rock-robotics.org">Rock
wiki</a></p>

<p>The Rock website is automatically generated using
<a href="http://webgen.rubyforge.org">webgen</a> from <a href="http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/quickref.html">Markdown
files</a> and uploaded to
rock-robotics.org. The markdown files are stored in <a href="http://github.com/rock-core/base-doc">a git repository on
github</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to update the Rock reference documentation, i.e. the Rock website,
you need first to check it out. From within a Rock installation, this can be
done with</p>

<pre><code>aup base/doc
</code></pre>

<p>The documentation is flavored, i.e. there is one branch for master, one branch
for next and one branch for stable. Make sure you edit the &ldquo;right&rdquo; branch. The
guideline is that anything that applies to stable should be done on the stable
branch as it is what new rock users see in the first place.</p>

<p>If you need to switch the branch (as, for instance, to edit the &lsquo;stable&rsquo;
documentation even though you are using the master flavor), just do</p>

<pre><code>git checkout -b stable autobuild/stable
</code></pre>

<p>The markdown file for e.g. documentation/orogen/index.html in
src/documentation/orogen/index.page.</p>

<p>Once you have done your modifications, run webgen once to be able to preview
them:</p>

<pre><code>rake
</code></pre>

<p>This will generate the HTML code in the base/doc/out/ directory. Simply open
base/doc/out/index.html with a web browser to see the generated website. Once
you are happy with your changes, commit them to git.</p>

<p>You then will <a href="https://github.com/rock-core/base-doc/pulls">propose your changes to the Rock developers</a> &hellip;
and get their thanks !</p>

<p>Finally, we are keen on improving the Rock documentation. Getting commit rights
on the Rock documentation repository is as easy as dropping an email to
the <a href="http://www.dfki.de/mailman/cgi-bin/listinfo/rock-dev">rock-dev mailing list</a>.</p>
