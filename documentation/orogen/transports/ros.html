<p>The ROS transport provides two main functionalities:</p>

<ul>
<li>the ability to generate ROS messages for every oroGen types that can be
represented in ROS (see &ldquo;Automatic ROS Message Convertions&rdquo; below).</li>
<li>the ability to reuse existing ROS messages as a way to transport oroGen
types. This is important to interface with a ROS system, as one should use
ROS common messages (see &ldquo;Reusing Existing ROS Messages&rdquo; below).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="automatic-ros-message-convertion">Automatic ROS Message Convertion</h2>

<p>There are two issues to consider when using the automatic ROS message convertion
feature of oroGen:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>naming</em>: ROS messages is much more limited than oroGen in how they can be
namespaced, so oroGen has to work around it.</li>
<li><em>limitations of the ROS types</em>. The following types cannot be represented
within ROS:
<ul>
<li>arrays-of-arrays and vectors-of-vectors</li>
<li>toplevel types that are not structures</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Naming of ROS messages</em>. For a_type/within_a_namespace/Type oroGen type which
is imported into an oroGen project called &ldquo;my_project&rdquo;, a ROS
message is generated which is named </p>

<pre><code>orogen_my_project_msgs/ATypeWithinANamespaceType
</code></pre>

<p><em>Limitations</em> The types that contain vectors-of-vectors or arrays-of-arrays are
not exported to ROS. Moreover, ports using types that are not structures (e.g.
std::vector&lt;MyStruct&gt;) can&rsquo;t be subscribed / published at runtime (i.e. oroGen
does not generate a corresponding boxed type).</p>

<h2 id="reusing-existing-ros-messages">Reusing Existing ROS Messages</h2>
<p>Existing ROS messages can be reused by specifying ros mappings in the oroGen
specification:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">typekit.ros_mappings '/a_type/within_a_namespace/Type' =&gt; 'sensor_msgs/Image'
</code></pre>

<p>The ros_mappings statement must be added after the import_types_from statements
that defined the relevant Rock type .  It can only be added for types that are
defined by this oroGen project. In other words, one cannot do an
import_types_from &ldquo;another_orogen_project&rdquo; and then add a mapping for a type
that is defined by another_orogen_project.</p>

<p>Note that once such a custom convertion is defined, it is reused by the
automatic ROS message generation presented above. So, for instance, since Rock&rsquo;s
base/orogen/types package defines a mapping between base::Time and ros::Time,
the messages generated for Rock types that contain a base::Time will use the
ros Time type in their place.</p>

<p>In addition, you will have to provide the code that converts from the Rock type
(on the left side of the mapping) and the ROS message (on the right side)
yourself. The convertion code is generated by oroGen, in the typekit/ROSConvertions.hpp and
typekit/ROSConvertions.cpp files. Once you have added the ros_mappings
statements, run orogen once (either by launching amake or by doing a make regen
in the build/ folder) to get these files. If they already existed (i.e. you are
adding new mappings), the templates/typekit/ROSConvertions.* files are updated
with the new convertion function signatures. Simply copy/paste the code in the
typekit/ files and fill-in the functions.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>For instance, let&rsquo;s assume that oroGen knows about a SingleRangeMeasurement type
with the signature</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">namespace sonar_sensor
{
struct SingleRangeMeasurement
{
base::Time time;
double error;
double distance;
};
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s assume that a package called &ldquo;sonar_msgs&rdquo; on the ROS side already
defined a message Range with the signature</p>

<pre><code>time time
float64 error
float64 distance
</code></pre>

<p>The corresponding oroGen file would be</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">name 'sonar_sensor'
using_library 'sonar_sensor'
import_types_from 'base'
import_types_from "sonar_sensor/SingleRangeMeasurement.hpp"
typekit.ros_mappings '/sonar_sensor/SingleRangeMeasurement' =&gt; 'sonar_msgs/Range'
</code></pre>

<p>Once generated, the two convertion functions would look like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">void toROS(sonar_msgs::Range&amp; ros,
     sonar_sensor::SingleRangeMeasurement const&amp; value)
{
// We have access to the ROS convertion methods for
// other types, as e.g. here, between base::Time and ros::Time,
// whose mapping is defined in base/orogen/types
//
// They are made available as we stated
// import_types_from 'base' in the oroGen file
toROS(ros.time, value.time);
ros.error = value.error;
ros.distance = value.distance;
}
void fromROS(sonar_sensor::SingleRangeMeasurement&amp; value,
       sonar_msgs::Range const&amp; ros)
{
fromROS(value.time, ros.time);
value.error = ros.error;
value.distance = ros.distance;
}
</code></pre>
