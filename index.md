What is Rock ?
==============

Rock is a software framework for the development of robotic systems. The
underlying component model is based on the Orocos RTT (Real Time
Toolkit). Rock provides all the tools required to set up and run
high-performance and reliable robotic systems for wide variety of
applications in research and industry. It contains a rich collection of
ready to use drivers and modules for use in your own system, and can
easily be extended by adding new components.
